* Overview
/Containers/ are completely isolated environments that have their own processes, network interfaces, and own mounts, just like a VM, but shares the same OS kernel.

The main purpose of Docker is to package and containerize applications, and to ship and run them anywhere, anytime, as many times as you want.

** Containers vs Images
A /docker image/ is a package/template and is used to create one or more containers.

/Containers/ run instances of images that are isolated and have their own environments and set of processes.
