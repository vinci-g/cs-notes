#+DESCRIPTION: Technical notes

The notes here are from books I am studying from [[https://teachyourselfcs.com][Teach Yourself CS]]. As a self taught software engineer, I want to fill up the knowledge gaps I have from not taking CS in university.

I am also learning about DevOps technologies and concepts from [[https://kodekloud.com][KodeKloud]].
