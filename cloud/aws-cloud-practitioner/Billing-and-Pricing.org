* General Billing in AWS

** Fundamentals of Pricing
There are three general drivers of billing:
1. Compute (Used/Requested)
2. Storage (Used/Requested)
3. Network (Used/Requested (Outbound only))

Pricing:
1. Duration Pricing
2. Request Pricing

Pricing Models:
1. On Demand
2. Savings Plan
   - Pay upfront and get more for what you paid for
3. Spot
   - Basically get excess capacity/resource to utilize until a customer uses it
4. Reservation
   - Reserve a service/resource and pay for it whether you use it or not

** Free Tier

* Impact of Account Structures on Billing
Consolidated billing is for multiple accounts but only one account (the payor account) gets billed for all the accounts.

For 2 or more accounts in an organization, it functions the same as consolidated billing.

Two or more accounts in Control Tower, still one payer for all the accounts.

Consolidated billing options allow for billing by account.
