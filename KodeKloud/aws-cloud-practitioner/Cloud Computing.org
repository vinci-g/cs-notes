* What is Cloud Computing?
Traditional IT services would be taking care of all the infrastructure, like installing new servers and hardware, operation and security installation, etc. which are all on-premise.

| Pros                  | Cons                       |
|-----------------------+----------------------------|
| Improved security     | Increased cost             |
| Greater customization | Limited scalability        |
| More control          | Responsible for everything |
|                       | Limited locations          |
|                       | More personnel             |
|                       | Long provisioning times    |

*Cloud computing* is the *on-demand* delivery of IT resources and works in a *client-server model* which is *pay-as-you-go* access to resources.

** Cloud Computing Models
- Cloud
  - Shared responsibility for Security and Operations
- On-Premise
  - All are in a data center
  - Responsible for all security and operations
- Hybrid
  - Some in cloud and some not in cloud

* AWS
With AWS compared to traditional IT:
- We can provision hardware (which is a service) that includes network and power.
- Get access to configurable services instead of managing physical objects.

** Core Service Categories
- Compute
- Network and Content Delivery
- Storage
- Database
- Security, Identity, and Compliance
- Management and Governance

** Ways to Communicate with AWS
- AWS Console (Web)
- AWS CLI
- AWS SDK (Software Development Kit)

* Benefits of the Cloud
1. Trade upfront expense for variable expense
   - Basically pay for what you use
2. Stop focusing on data centers
   - More focus on customers and applications
3. Stop guessing capacity
   - Scale in and out as needed
4. Benefit from massive economies of scale
   - Price drop per unit used
5. Increase provision speed and business agility
   - Provision in seconds or minutes
6. Go global in minutes
   - AWS global infrastructure available globally

* Cloud Economics
- Free Tier
  - AWS has a free tier that offers free services either forever or for a specific time period.
- On-Demand
  - Basically pay for what you need and use
- Reservations
  - Commit paying to a service for a specific time which AWS gives a discount
- Volume Discounts
  - More unit consumption, less price
- Price Drops
  - AWS does price drops on their services

* Cloud Design Principles
- Design for Failure
  - Be intentional about failure and add redundancy
  - Increased resiliency
- Decouple Components
  - Put a queue or scaling layer in between components
  - Components should be loosely coupled and flexible in sudden change in traffic
- Implement Elasticity
  - Scale up and down as you need it
- Think Parallel
  - Increase concurrency
  - Think about doing things horizontally instead of vertically
