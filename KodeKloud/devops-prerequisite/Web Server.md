## Introduction

There are multiple application types namely:

1. Desktop
2. Mobile
3. Web
4. Analytics
5. Problem Solving

Each of these applications can be categorized into either *standalone* or *client-server* model. Our desktop calculator app is an example of a standalone application as all logic is inside the application itself. Slack on another hand is an example of a client-server application as it needs to communicate with a server to deliver messages.

### Servers

There are different kinds of servers for example:

- Web Servers - serves web content
- Application Servers - backend that is responsible for the business logic
- DB Servers
- Email Servers
- Backup Servers

To name a few.

These servers have programs that listen for incoming requests in a particular port and these programs are what makes them servers otherwise they are just another virtual/physical machine.

In small scale, we could only have a single server that serves both web and application logic but in larger scale applications, we can see that it can split into different services that handle different parts of a system.

## Web Frameworks

Some popular web frameworks are:

1. Express (NodeJS)
2. Spring (Java)
3. Django (Python)
4. Flask (Python)
