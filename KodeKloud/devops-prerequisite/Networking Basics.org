* Switching
Switching connnects systems within the same network.

To connect the two systems:
1. We need an interface on each host, physical or virtual.
   a. We use the ~ip link~ command to see the interfaces for the hosts
2. We assign then the systems with ip addresses on the same network using ~ip addr add <ip>/24 dev eth0~.
   a. ~ip~ - command for interacting with network devices in Linux
   b. ~addr~ - subcommand to manipulate IP addresses and routes
   c. ~add~ - option to add an IP address
   d. ~<ip>/24~ - IP address being assigned while ~/24~ basically says that it's a subnet with 256 addresses (from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255)
   e. ~dev eth0~ - network interface the IP is being assigned (could be gotten from ~ip link~, ~eth0~ in this case)

* Routing
Routing is the use of routers to connect to different networks together.

In is assigned two IPs since it is connected to two separate networks.

* Gateway
It is basically a "gateway" where systems can "pass-through" to reach another system in another network via a router.
