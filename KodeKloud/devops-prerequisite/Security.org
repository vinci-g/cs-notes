Ensure communication between the user and the server is encrypted and trusted.

*Symmetric encryption* is a type of encryption that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a data and is passed between the sender and the reciever. *Asymmetric encryption* uses a /private key/ and a /public key (or lock)/

For SSH, we generate a pair of public and private keys using:

#+begin_src shell
ssh-keygen -t <type of key>
#+end_src

Type of keys consist of ~ed25519~, ~rsa~, ~dsa~, ~ecdsa~.

For OpenSSL that is used for SSL/TLS protocols:

#+begin_src shell
openssl genrsa -out my-bank.key 1024
#+end_src

The command above generates a 1024 bit RSA key and writes it to a file called ~my-bank.key~.

#+begin_src shell
openssl rsa -in my-bank.key -pubout > my-bank.pem
#+end_src

The command above generates a public key at ~my-bank.pem~.

To ensure that certificates are secure, it should be approved and validated by a /Certficate Authority/.

Public keys normally have the ~.crt~ or ~.pem~ extension and private keys usually have ~.key~ or ~*-key.pem~ extensionprivate.
