# A Tour of Computer Systems (Marginalia Method)

*code/intro/hello.c*
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}
```


## 1.1 Information is Bits + Context

- The `hello` program (source file) which a programmer creates is a sequence of bits organized in 8bit chunks called bytes.
- Each character is represented with a unique byte size interger value using the ASCII standard.
- Each character in a source file is represented with unique byte size interger values following the ASCII standard.
- A source file which is consists of exclusively ASCII characters are called *text files* and all other kinds of files are known as *binary files*.
  - *Text files*: only ASCII characters
  - *Binary files*: all other files
- All information in a system is represented by a bunch of bits.

## 1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms

- To run `hello.c`(source file) in a system, it must be translated to *machine language* instructions and packaged as a *executable object program*.
- A *compiler driver* (in this case `GCC` for `C` programs) is used to translate source file to object file and undergoes four phases called the *compilation system*.

```
linux> gcc -o hello hello.c
```

> `gcc` is the compiler, -o is an argument/option to *output* the source code, `hello` is the name of the executable, and `hello.c` is our source file

- **Preprocessor Phase** modifies the source code according to the directives (begins with `#`) and outputs text file with `.i` suffix.
