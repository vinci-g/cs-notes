* Buffer Names
- ~(buffer-name)~ returns the current buffer name
- ~(buffer-file-name)~ returns the absolute path of the current buffer

* Getting Buffers
The /buffer name/ is not the buffer itself but only the representation of what the buffer is called. To get the actual buffer, we can use the function ~(current-buffer)~.

This will return ~#<buffer *scratch*>~.

Another function is ~(other-buffer)~ and returns the last visited buffer.

* Buffer Size and the Location of Point
- ~(buffer-size)~ tells the size of the current buffer in the count of the number of characters
- ~(point)~ returns a number on where the cursor is as a count of number of characters from the beginning of the buffer up to the point
