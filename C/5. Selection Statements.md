# Selection Statments

## Logical Expressions

Relational operators like <, >, <=, and >= produces 0 (false) or 1 (true).

Equality operators, which tests for equality between two values (==(equal to) and !=(not equal to)) and have lower precedence over relational operators

Logical operators !(unary, inverts the value), &&(produces 1 if both values are non zero), and ||(binary, produces one if either value is non zero)

## The `if` Statement

``` c
  if (n < 0) {
    printf("n is less than 0\n");
   }
   else if (n == 0) {
     printf("n is equal to 0\n");
   }
   else {
     printf("n is greater than 0\n");
   }

  // the code below is the same even without braces
  if (n < 0) 
    printf("n is less than 0\n");

   else if (n == 0) 
     printf("n is equal to 0\n");

   else 
     printf("n is greater than 0\n");
```

Example Program: [broker.c](./sample-program/broker.c)

When `if` statements are nested, we have to watch out for a dangling `else`.

``` c
  if (y != 0)
    if (x != 0)
      result = x/y;
    else
      printf("Error: y is equal to 0\n")
```

The code above suggests through indentation that the `else` statement belongs to the inner `if` but that is simply not true. C follows a rule that an `else` statement belongs to the nearest `if` statement, so the code above looks like this

``` c
  if (y != 0)
    if (x != 0)
      result = x/y;
    else
      printf("Error: y is equal to 0\n")
```

To make our conditional statements more cleaner, it is advised to use curly braces.

``` c
  if (y != 0) {
    if (x != 0)
      result = x/y;    
   }
   else
     printf("Error: y is equal to 0\n")
```

### Conditional Expressions

```c
  expr1 ? expr2 : expr3
```
