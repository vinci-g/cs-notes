## Arithmetic Operators

|Unary|Binary|
|---|---|
|+ unary plus<br>- unary minus|+ addition<br>- subtraction<br>* multiplication<br>/ division<br>% remainder|

*Additive* and *multiplicative* operators are binary because they require *two* operands.

*Unary* operators only require *one* operand. It does nothing and only used to emphasize that a numeric constant is positive.

Binary operators allow interger or float operands with the exception of `%`, with mixing allowed.
- `/` operator truncates the resilt by dropping the fractional part when both of its operands are integers.
	- 1/2 is 0 and not 0.5
- `%` operator requires integer operands. If either operand is not an integer the program won't compile.
