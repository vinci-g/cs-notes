## Arithmetic Operators

|Unary|Binary|
|---|---|
|+ unary plus<br>- unary minus|+ addition<br>- subtraction<br>* multiplication<br>/ division<br>% remainder|

*Additive* and *multiplicative* operators are binary because they require *two* operands.

*Unary* operators only require *one* operand. It does nothing and only used to emphasize that a numeric constant is positive.

Binary operators allow interger or float operands with the exception of `%`, with mixing allowed.
- `/` operator truncates the resilt by dropping the fractional part when both of its operands are integers.
	- 1/2 is 0 and not 0.5
- `%` operator requires integer operands. If either operand is not an integer the program won't compile.

## Increment & Decrement Operators

```c
i = i + 1;
i += 1;
```

C also allows `++` and `--` to increment and decrement respectively but take note that `++` and `--` can both be used as a *prefix* and *postfix* operator.

Using it as a *prefix* operator on `i`:
```c
i = 1;
printf("i is %d\n", ++i); // prints as 2
printf("i is %d\n:, i"); // prints as 2
```

Using it as a *postfix* operator:
```c
i = 1;
printf("i is %d\n", i++); // prints as 1
printf("i is %d\n:, i"); // prints as 2
```
